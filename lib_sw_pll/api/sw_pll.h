/**
 * sw_lut_pll initialisation function.
 *
 * This must be called before use of sw_pll_lut_do_control.
 * Call this passing a pointer to the sw_pll_state_t stuct declared locally.
 *
 * \param sw_pll                Pointer to the struct to be initialised.
 * \param Kp                    Proportional PI constant. Use SW_PLL_15Q16() to convert from a float.
 * \param Ki                    Integral PI constant. Use SW_PLL_15Q16() to convert from a float.
 * \param Kii                   Double integral PI constant. Use SW_PLL_15Q16() to convert from a float.
 * \param loop_rate_count       How many counts of the call to sw_pll_lut_do_control before control is done.
 *                              Note this is only used by sw_pll_lut_do_control. sw_pll_lut_do_control_from_error
 *                              calls the control loop every time so this is ignored.
 * \param pll_ratio             Integer ratio between input reference clock and the PLL output.
 *                              Only used by sw_pll_lut_do_control for the PFD. Don't care otherwise.

 * \param ref_clk_expected_inc  Expected ref clock increment each time sw_pll_lut_do_control is called.
 *                              Pass in zero if you are sure the mclk sampling timing is precise. This
 *                              will disable the scaling of the mclk count inside sw_pll_lut_do_control.
 *                              Only used by  sw_pll_lut_do_control. Don't care otherwise.
 * \param lut_table_base        Pointer to the base of the fractional PLL LUT used
 * \param num_lut_entries       Number of entries in the LUT (half sizeof since entries are 16b)

 * \param app_pll_div_reg_val   The setting of the app pll divider register.
 * \param nominal_lut_idx       The index into the LUT which gives the nominal output. Normally
 *                              close to halfway to allow symmetrical range.
 * \param ppm_range             The pre-calculated PPM range. Used to determine the maximum deviation
 *                              of counted mclk before the PLL resets its state.
 *                              Note this is only used by sw_pll_lut_do_control. sw_pll_lut_do_control_from_error
